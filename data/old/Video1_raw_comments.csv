"I'm not proud to admit it, but I legitimately have Ablutophobia. Ever since 
I was a baby I've never liked bathing or showering. I am 19 now and still 
have it, I usually take a shower about once a week, and when I do I 
hyperventilate during most of the duration because the feeling of water 
pouring over me is terrifying. Bathing is better though, unless I'm in a 
big pool where I can be submerged. If I submerge myself I get a 
panic-attack.

I know I don't have a ""bad"" case though, since I CAN take a shower.

"I never thought about avoiding the feeling of love and hating having to go 
to sleep as a phobia...
I think I might have a minor phobia of these both... like I always dread 
going to sleep and such because I always seem to have 
nightmares/uncomforting dreams so I usually hate the time I have to sleep 
so end up avoiding it...
I also hate it when I feel something for someone and freak out when I like 
someone because I get so obsessive about it.
I also fear people loving me back as it usually makes me feel awkward... 
but it might just be because I hate the word a lot and avoid using it other 
than to describe it or whatever.
I also have a phobia of craneflies and people holding sharp objects and 
loss of air.... but those three are WAY worse than not enjoying sleep and 
being scared of love...<U+FEFF>"

cross a long bridge to go to school. I hated waking up and having to go, so 
I spent the night listening to music. Didn't do me much good.
4. Have it. I have agoraphobia, and the sunlight reminds me of vacations I 
took when I was little.
8. Have it (and experiencing the consequences). I go to the internet for 
stimulation. I despise it when something in real life changes.

2 birds with one stone ;). also, as a kid growing up in the 90's the only 
thing i could do for fun in my small town was to ride our bikes to the pond 
and a family of overly aggressive canadian geese would always chase us away 
from our picnics, bite our sandwiches out of our hands, and would hiss

things.  And since I have extremely sensitive skin, and when I was younger

etc, ever.

I also have Ablutophobia, I hate bathing/cleaning, or being wet in general 
(swimming, playing in the rain, etc).  Most of this is attributed to being 
a co-morbid of the extreme sensitivities I suffer from due to my Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (high functioning).

Oh and in answer to your question, yes, I am afraid of the fear of 
everything because I'm constantly wondering if I am letting it run my life, 
and if I am, why can't I tell?

The mind is a crazy thing.

skin on the tip of my finger, like 1.5 mm deep and 5 mm wide.

I don't get that reaction with very superficial cuts, though, but not even 
with bruises or severe internal wounds. Once I had an organ that twisted in 
my abdomen and almost killed me and I was not that scared, and once I broke 
a tendon in my foot and it hurt but I was not losing consciousness. It's

"The only phobia I have is arachnophobia (fear of spiders) because spiders 
are freaking creepy. If I see one, I'll be like ""Meh"" but I'll still panic 
a little bit. If a spider was on me or crawling up my arm or something like 
that, I would kind of freak out. I would either just stare with a look of 
panic (Something I do when I'm scared. It's normal.) or swat it away as 
fast as possible. Now, NIGHTMARES about spiders... That's another story. I 
FREAK OUT if I have a nightmare about evil spiders. Once I had some 
nightmare about a boy who went on a little adventure with his grandfather 
(it was basically just like Ib, but with little spiders everywhere). At the 
end they were in their beds saying goodnight. Then the boy's dad came in as 
a giant spider with human legs (I dunno but I think they were black and 
hairy like spiders are) and he went to the boy's bed. The boy couldn't see 
that his dad was a spider because the light was off and it was dark. The 
dad just said ""Good night..."" before he killed the boy and ate him. THAT'S

"I'm scared of my home. There's a room right across from mine that always 
has boxes in it. I'm too afraid to go in there or any where upstairs 
because I swear everynight I see something pass through that room. Every 
time I go upstairs it's to sleep or get something. I am terrified of 
downstairs as well because I fear what ever is in there will follow me 
downstairs. The house just is a bad design because most rooms are upstairs. 
On an unrelated note I always have a feeling whatever is upstairs is small, 
but not a bug because after I run down the stairs I can still hear 
creaking, though my feet are on the ground. Terrifying. Every time I enter 
my room I check to make sure everything is where I left it to see if 
someone something is moving or taking my stuff. I always feel watched in 
that house. Anywhere outside I feel like it's gone. Yes, it is a real fear, 
and it's real scary.<U+FEFF>"
